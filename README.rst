This program is designed to help manage `DANE (TLSA) <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6698>`_ records on a server using `Let's Encrypt <https://letsencrypt.org/>`_ certificates. Specifically, if you are thinking of using DANE to secure a service encrypted with Let's Encrypt certificates, you will at least need a reliable way to update your DNS TLSA records when your TLS certificates are renewed. This program can help you do this.

Status
======

Code is in beta. Program is functional, but more testing is required.
If you wish to use the program, then you will likely find that the program
works, but *may* be temperamental to changes in your setup. Thus, it is
recommended that you check that everything works by forcing a certificate
renewal, if you can, and to also keep a check on automated renewals, if
error reporting mechanisms are not already in place.

.. note::
    The code is being rewritten from scratch to add functionality and to
    make a few improvements (esecially to increase its robustness).
    This will hopefully not take too long -- 2019/10/1
