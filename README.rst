This program is designed to help manage `DANE (TLSA) <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6698>`_ records on a server using `Let's Encrypt <https://letsencrypt.org/>`_ certificates. Specifically, if you are thinking of using DANE to secure a service encrypted with Let's Encrypt certificates, you will at least need a reliable way to update your DNS TLSA records when your TLS certificates are renewed. This program can help you do this.
